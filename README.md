# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## Introduction

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about the passengers on the Titanic. The objective is to uncover patterns and correlations between different features of the dataset. This task was completed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Key Findings

1. **Gender and Survival**: A higher percentage of females survived compared to males.
2. **Class and Survival**: Passengers in 1st class had a higher survival rate compared to those in 2nd and 3rd classes.
3. **Age Distribution**: Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.
4. **Fare and Survival**: Higher fares were associated with higher survival rates.

## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the relationships between various features and survival rates. The use of heatmaps and other visualizations helped in identifying key patterns and correlations.
